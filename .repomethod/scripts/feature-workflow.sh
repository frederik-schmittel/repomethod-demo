1. Quick Plan: record Goal, Scope, Test in at most three bullets.
2. Implement the smallest testable change in the current agent session using existing skills.
3. Run the targeted test for the changed behavior.
4. If it fails, make one correction and rerun the same targeted test.
5. Return the testable MVP with changed files and the test result.
6. Close out with: .repomethod/scripts/deliver.sh --quick
   (verify-command + no protected zone touched + a free-text note in

Plan obligations are not applicable in this stateless path.
No research, graph state, subagents, packetization, or spec in this path.

Create a bounded implementation state with:
.repomethod/scripts/feature-workflow.sh classic init --feature <slug> --verify-command ".repomethod/scripts/agent-gate.sh --spec specs/<slug>.md"
Classic runs Implementation -> configured verification command -> Completion.
Initialization also creates the feature-scoped append-only descope ledger.
Record an intentionally omitted plan obligation with descope-ledger.sh add and
append an accepted/rejected review with descope-ledger.sh review. Delivery is
blocked while any current descope is unreviewed or rejected.
Verification failures create a bounded Fix -> Verification loop.
If the feature spec declares ## Plan Obligations, run plan-obligations.sh extract
and approve the current extraction revision before any downstream check consumes it.

Research -> Plan -> obligation extraction/review -> execution graph approval -> Implementation -> Verification -> Completion.
Initialization also creates the feature-scoped append-only descope ledger.
Any intentionally omitted obl.<anchor> must be recorded with descope-ledger.sh;
unreviewed or rejected descopes block delivery and accepted descopes remain in handoff provenance.
Declare normative statements in specs/<feature>.md under ## Plan Obligations.
Run plan-obligations.sh extract after planning and approve that exact extraction
revision before downstream checks consume it. Editing the section creates a new
pending revision. Then preview and approve the execution graph as usual.
